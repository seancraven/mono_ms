	This report uses Group Covonlutions~\cite{cohen2016group} to construct Equivariant networks used to parameterize reinforcement learning agents, which act in symmetric environments. The Group Convolutions enable the symmetries of the environments to be encoded into the networks, enabling superior generalization. On investigation, using equivariant networks provides substantially better sample efficiency for the reinforcement learning agents. When applied to a model-based setting, equivariant transition models demonstrated superior sample efficiency in learning and outperformed conventional multi-layer perceptron architectures on the symmetric environments tested. However, in the experiments with the Dyna model-based algorithm learning transition models online, was unsuccessful.
