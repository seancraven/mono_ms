\section{Introduction}
Encoding equivariance into agent networks has been an effective inductive bias for Reinforcement learning agents in symmetric environments. Enabling agents to learn effective policies with superior sample efficiency \cite{van2020plannable, mondal2020group} or learn policies on previously unapproachable tasks \cite{wang2022so2}.

In our preliminary findings we investigate extending the equivariant inductive bias to a transition model of the environment, enabling an agent to learn a planning capable world model with fewer interactions with the Markov Decision Process (MDP).
